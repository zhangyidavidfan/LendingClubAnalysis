# LendingClubAnalysis

## Lending Club’s legacy
An innovator in the long held institutional based lending process, a global leader in the space of peer-to-peer monetary platform, and an enabler to low-cost loans and alternative investment options, Lending Club is undoubtedly a leader in its field today. Over its now 10 years of existence, Lending Club has helped millions of individuals across various purposes (from business development to personal finances) to achieve their dreams and goals. Its commitment to excellence and customer experience has anchored its current position and is helping them set sail for future success.

## The Challenge with Growth
The heightened demand comes with its unique challenges. Lending Club, being a fast growing and scaling company faces the prominent problem of balancing its reach (continually serving a massive span of individual) while maintaining the quality of its product. It is paramount to Lending Club to ensure the quality of loans in its portfolio without comprising and denying too much services. In this paper I will want to take the lense of as a Lending Club employee or executives trying to optimize for its loan selection. This paper seeks to examine this particular area with four main components:

### 1.       To Understand The Business
The first section of this analysis-driven paper will focus on scoping out the main driver of Lending Club’s success and unprecedented growth, while also outlining the potential issue that the business currently faces. I seek to use this section to illustrate the importance and main value proposition of this study. In particular, under this section I will be looking into the three main areas that constituted the success of lending club (the quantity of loans, the retention of borrowers and the average amount per loan) and also an area of potential improvement (stagnant loan quality).


### 2.       To Explore Potential Risk Factors
The second part of this paper will introduce the scope of the analysis, the features involved and engineered, posing hypotheses and explore related variables that may contribute to the default rates (such as interest rate, geographic locations, words in the description). This section will also examine the appropriate risk ratio, or in other words the appropriate weight given to different kind of errors (False Positive and False Negative), to be employed in the evaluation of our final model.

### 3.       To Build a Prediction
The third part of this paper will employ standard modelling techniques ranging from logistic regression to elastic net in order to select the best model that outputs the most accurate prediction. A base benchmark model will be employed and hyperparameter tuning will be done. Analysis will also be made and drawn from the model output to verify previously held hypothesis from Part 2.

### 4.       To Conclude and Recommend
The last part of this paper will focus on the assessment of the potential impact if the model were to be employed. It will also offer  possible recommendations to Lending Club in how it may use the analyses derived to prevent loan default. Furthermore, I will also address the limitations of the paper and  room for various improvements

## Data Source
The data employed in this analysis is the openly available lending club data on Kaggle. It contains relevant fields of information (to be further explained later on) on all approved Lending Club loans from 2007 -2011.
